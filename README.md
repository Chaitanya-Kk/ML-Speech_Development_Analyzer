# Spectrogram-Based Computer Vision Model

This repository contains a project implementing a computer vision model based on spectrogram analysis. The model is designed to process audio signals, convert them into spectrograms, and use these spectrograms for image-based machine learning tasks.  

## Features  
- Converts audio signals to spectrograms for analysis.  
- Employs machine learning algorithms to classify or predict based on spectrogram data.  
- Custom preprocessing steps to optimize spectrogram generation.  
- Visualization tools to inspect the spectrograms and the model's outputs.
